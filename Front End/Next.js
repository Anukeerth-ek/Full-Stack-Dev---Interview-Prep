// 1. What is Next.js and why would you use it?
// ans:
// Next.js is a React framework that enables server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG) for React applications. 
// It's used to build performant, SEO-friendly web applications with features like automatic code splitting, optimized performance, 
// and built-in routing.

// 2. Explain the concept of server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js.
// ans:
// SSR in Next.js involves rendering React components on the server at request time, generating the HTML for a page before sending it to the client. 
// This can improve SEO and performance since the initial page load is faster and search engines can easily index the content.

// 3. What is static site generation (SSG) and how does it differ from SSR?
// ans:
// SSG generates HTML pages at build time, rather than on each request like SSR. This results in faster load times for end users and less server load. 
// However, it means the content is static and needs to be rebuilt to reflect updates.
